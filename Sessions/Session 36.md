mostly half elves at the elven embassy
[[Ghostia Aluana|Ghostia]] did her research on us

Asking if we intend to stay in the [[United City States|UCS]]
the guild ambassador wants the [[United City States|UCS]] to go to war with the guild
trying to get information about what the low ranking members think about war
she is desperate to stay
tells us the king has taken an heir
- Young, not of any house
- like ellisra "from somewhere else"
	- Fae probably
- the heir seems temperamental and the kind seems willing to indulge their impulses

**Doing [[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]]'s Ritual**
in the professors office
behind the door
- footprints walking along the ground
- [[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] follows
- into a door we can't reach
- they are her footprints
- lead into the university
- walk straight through [[Dolly]]'s greenhouse
No professor matching [[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]]'s description of her patron

after the ritual only [[Reggie]] can see the doorknob

[[Dolly]] caught [[Reggie]] snooping
[[Dolly]] also sees the door
its dungeon gold
[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] learns she is a warlock
[[Val Amicaar]]'s grandfathers wards should not have been able to cause the destruction of a dungeon

the door leads to [[The Proffesora]]'s office
she seems to be happy that [[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] managed to find her office
she cant leave her office
- [[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]]'s job is to find out how to let her

she used to be somewhere else
was a djinn there
not a dungeon
some sort of demi-plane
similar to dungeons
[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] is not the only one (she is the favorite though)
she wants to punch a whole into a dungeon to her office
hopes to escape to the material plane through it
wants to feel the real world again
professor Amiicir cracked exitance enough to let her make the door
there are two others

Our team name is [[The Redacted]]

hound sends an image of a powerful fey ruler
- death immanent death inevitable
a knight of spring in front of them
a sword at each others throat then thrust into the ground
