we traveling with [[Branch]] and [[Dima]]
they are related somehow that I have entirely forgotten

[[Pillany]] has something to do with [[The Outbreak]] 100 years ago
- Probably something to do with the dungeons
the colonial wars where 300 years ago

[[Branch]] seems to have something against magic
- Reacts like it is some sort of disease

[[Pillany]] Guild hall and Trade Union
- List of classes on the door

all guild halls have to give back to the locals

[[The Outpost]] is the local colony dungeon
get to it through the northern watch tower through a shoot
undead
dead people are pretty easy to find
weird artificer shit
its definitely just hospital

[[Rivet Coldhammer]]
- runs [[Pillany]] guild hall

Contracts
- Underhill
- Neon's
- Rescue mission in [[The Outpost]]
	- Former councilor of the colonies Henrietta
	- Attempting experimental magic on the fifth floor
	- Been posted for 25 years

The outbreak was zombies

[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]]'s magic comes from elsewhere
[[Val Amicaar|Val]]'s comes from a well inside
[[Peppercorn Meadowfort|Pep]]'s draws it in from the world

there is a complete double of ell that lives in the mana plane
when she fey steps she fully becomes mana
naturally draws mana to herself like a magnet

[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] is dreaming about [[The Proffesora]]
- she's being a bitch
- specifically about trying to draw power from elsewhere
- she wants to recreate the outpost
- because the outpost has mana spread far out
- probably specifically the outbreak
- she wishes to spread her domain in the same way

[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] lies to the rest of the party about the dream

[[The Outpost]] was stabilized by creation of monsters outside the dungeon
fear that the infection still remains

[[Calidy of Mount Pataro|Candy]] also lied about asking about the outpost

we get on the boat of [[Captain Captain Longspoon]]
he definitely charges way more than he should have

[[Vin]] takes us to the guild hall on a dog sled
he charges way less than he should have

We meet [[Krali]] she's a gnome in half plate
also presumably [[Elijah Kohn|Eli]]
[[Krali]] did try to retire
you can just be elected councilor

currently 4 and a half attempting to scour [[Underhill]]
[[Underhill]]
- someone has argued that the amount of time passed is related to emotional development
- Things will ambush from snow
