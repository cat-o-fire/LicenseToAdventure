The exit was described in the writings as a portrait
the movements of our mirrors in the dungeon are not in sync
occasionally a little behind occasionally a little ahead
there is the mountain and the upside down mountain and our mirrors will be on the other side of it

it is in fact a big mountain

there are the occasional plants around

we are descending

there is a group of people being attacked by something

[[Reggie]] saw a paladin mirroring him on the opposite mountain

we find a shack with a lot of bones in it

by the fire, by the cot, under and on the table

its bad its super cursed

we meet another party
- [[Roma]] - he/him, ranger
- [[Indigo]] - she/her, elf with a purple cape
- [[Shewa]] - they/them, dwarf with a big fuck off axe

[[Reggie]]'s dreams are negging him
- trying to get him to seek more power

the yarn home was cut
something bigger than a human
removed the other end of the yarn
[[Reggie]] is being avoidant about his dreams
