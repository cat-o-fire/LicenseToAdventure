Candy is relatively unharmed
Ellisra is getting caught up
They created a dungeon in [[Troya]]
[[Edmund]] is the banned [[Linellia|Linellian]] heir
The pumpkin pie is in fact magic

In Joanna's dream
- DGF is absent to [[Joanna]]
- [[Val]] can see but not do
- first time [[Joanna]] has been in the cavern without DGF there
- Cavern is carved
- The same lettering as the untranslated book is carved into the stone table
	- Imagery of the four seasons
	- has a similar vibe to [[Linellia|Linellian]] funeral rites
- there is running water, [[Joanna]] stands on a bridge
- same false light as the [[Vegar]] dungeon
- DGF not escaped, not scared off by [[Val]]
