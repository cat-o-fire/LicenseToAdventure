Structure of the Autumn Court
- story of a small young girl who grew frustrated about being treated like glass
	- faerie answered her calls
	- faerie erased her identity
	- and when she begged to have things go back the faerie turned her to glass
- Guild studies on the fae
	- Pre-date dungeons
	- sometimes fae things appear in dungeons
	- There are four courts, one for each season
	- for the past quite a long time the dominant courts have been autumn and spring
	- interesting because they represent transition
	- hard to get information on the fae
	- [[Linellia]] claims to be founded by the fae taking their chances on the mortal plane, giving up the everchanging for certainty
	- spring and autumn are always at war (whether or not battles take place is unclear)
	- season matches whatever court is closest to the material plane
	- Pumpkin prince is missing
		- For a long time
		- autumn is currently weak
		- letting spring grow in power
- [[Ellisra Lelnam|Ellisra]] has a direct line of descent to the supposed original elves
- the pumpkin prince was exiled for comiting some sort of crime
- autumn needs a new heir
