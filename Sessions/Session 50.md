# Vision of the Past
[[Kollette]]: Bringing back the dead?
[[Astrid]]: [[The Guild]]'s greatest secret
A vision of a young [[Greed]]
battle worn bloodied
tears out the heart of [[Wrath]] Ditchio former head of the family
a woman appears to her
- [[Danny]]
"Its over its not worth it just kill him"
"this is it i can have him back"
"He's dead don't you get that hes fucking dead"
looks to [[Cutter]]
"Can't you feel it the dungeon wants him, it wants me, it wants us"
[[Danny]] and [[Greed]] fight
[[Danny]] walks away
a dungeon forms around them

[[Cutter]] and [[Greed]] are monsters of [[The Last Rest]]
[[Greed]] has aged, slower than she should have
[[Cutter]] does not, he is just acting out [[Greed]]'s fantasy

# Vision of the Present
[[Gerard]]: Why did rudolf get kicked out of the games
we are taken to a land of tundra, a faint jingle of sleigh bells
The Reindeer games
the Antarctic
Rudolf was a drunk
[[Masha]] the sugarplum beat Rudolf
# Vision of the Future
there is a battlefield with a warrior in completely golden armor stands in a collapsed city
nothing but destruction surrounds, says "what didnt see it coming?"
the city is wrong, we are not on sor
[[Reggie]] is under the helmet
more power than he could know what to do with, no emotional attachments
the dungeons will devour sor is they are able to win
[[Freezy]] has seen [[Reggie]] at the bottom of her dungeon
