[[Reggie]] gets two letters
- One from his moms
- one from [[Paul]]
- 

[[Val]] gets two notes
- one from [[Dolly]]
	- He has a pass to get in to the university to get his grandfathers things
- one from 
	- There will be an after noon tea held at the [[Linellia|Linellian]] embassy by [[Ghostia Aluana]]

[[Edmund]] is not decided on [[Linellia]] v [[The Guild]]

[[Dolly]] office is not much difference from [[Val]]'s grandfathers
not entirely cleared out either

lots of soil
poor book care (dogeared and left open)


[[Reinhart]] is the only person to have defeated a dungeon boss and it is also the most stable dungeon

[[Val]]'s grandfather believed that the dungeons where a blight

[[Dolly]] obviously does not
- also she is a level 9 wizard

he was obsessed with dungeon bosses ability to control the dungeon
[[Cutter]] and [[Greed]]'s control of [[The Last Rest]] and the mistress's control of [[The Manor]]
[[The Manor]] is very consistent and controlled seemingly by her
[[The Tower to Heaven]] is one of the least stable dungeons
- they have not found the boss or the top of the tower

he seemed to be planning to try and defeat a boss

[[The Last Rest]] is one of the least stable dungeons
- incomplete in some way

[[Edmund]]'s primary concern is research
[[The Guild]] as a whole has no official statement
shifting blame to [[The Chairman]]
[[Edmund]] is focusing on [[United City States|UCS]] loyalties rather than guild loyalties

[[Pumpkin Hound]] showed up
fox bite in the flesh
fighting with fox made of delicate white petals fighting with the hound
sends the name of [[Stubborn Blade of Glass]] sticking up between the frost, rain reaching the ground through leaves, windows being opened and fresh air coming in, stubborn survival, the stubborn refusal to be moved
> what does that mean for us?
- the hound puts a paws on the top of her head
- points to the symbol of the [[Linellia|Linellian]] royalty
